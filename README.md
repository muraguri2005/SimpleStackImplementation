# Simple Implementation of Stack Data Structure using Swift Programming language
A Stack is a data structure where elements are added at the head of the list and removed from the end. It is a data structure where data that was last entered is data that will be first removed (Last in First Out).
In this implementation we used two main classes to achieve that: Node & Stack. Node keeps track of the data and reference to the next element in the stack. Stack keeps track of the head of the stack. pop and push functions are implemented here.
